# qamp-demo-02-23

This repo contains the materials for our [Qiskit Demoday](https://github.com/Qiskit/feedback/wiki/Qiskit-DemoDays) presentations on Feb 9, 2023, where we talked about our contributions to [Qiskit QEC](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-qec), an open-source framework for quantum error correction. The presentations summarize the work we have completed during the Qiskit Advocate Mentorship Program (QAMP) Fall 2022, under the supervision of [Grace Harper](https://github.com/grace-harper-ibm) and [Drew Vandeth](https://github.com/dsvandet).
